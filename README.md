# SurveillenceSystem
 Due to an increase in robbery cases in ATM kiosks ,It is necessary to increase its  security. This can be achieved by an automated surveillance system.Currently what happens is there is a camera that is attached to the ATM unit that records the video and sent it to the main server of the bank.Early detection of unwanted situations is necessary for taking preventive measures, for which, round the clock surveillance system should work properly by utilizing minimum bandwidth and power. In this project we are going to propose a methodology which is capable of detecting  following activities :
Detecting Human inside the ATM
Multiple person detection in ATM
Camera Covering
Masked face detection.
If a person is taking more than usual time to complete his/her work.

The Complete Life Cycle model is discussed for the Unwanted Activity Detection System. The intended users for this project are banks which can incorporate this project with their CCTV cameras.
